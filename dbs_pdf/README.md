# Reading texts in pdf 

used `pytessaract` to extract texts from pdf. 
challenge remains as we cant extract the plots and tables in correct form, and if we are to convert them into text-readable pdfs, we have to incorporate this with reportlab and finetune for every page of the pdf. 
works to be done in the next project.
